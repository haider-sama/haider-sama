Hello. This is Haider. A mechatronics student and a web-developer. You have been roaming around lately and have stumbled upon the domain which is known as my github profile. Rest here, fellow warrior. Make a cup of tea and relax and enjoy the surrounding around you. 
<br />
Some of my hobbies include programming things which I like, to build, to see them in shape. I've used to do source-engine mapping in the past. Along, with a few of my hobby projects that I'm working on. My first anime is Dragon-Ball-Z which I grew up watching, made me learn a lot of things that I couldn't have learnt without it. Some of the major scenes in Z are top-notch. Enough to push a man to shatter limits and shackles of doubt that would seperate a legend from a trespasser in this vastness of space that we live in. Positive enough to say that I'm a follower of it and know inside-out of the series. Whether, it's Z or GT. My favourites techniques in the series are Kaio-ken(界王拳), Dragon-First(龍拳), Ultra Instinct (身勝手の極意 (Migatte no Gokui)), Bukūjutsu (舞空術). My other hobbies including sketching, primarily dragon ball characters, I also practive martial arts, including boxing, muay thai and wrestling. 
<br />
I've a lot of interesting projects and goals that I'll build and complete in the near future. The best strategy is to write down your goals at the start of the year and then follow a weekly consistent plan. Slowly, but gradually. You acheive what you've written down. Works for me everytime for the past 2 years. 2025 is about to end in 4 months and I've already completed almost all of my goals that I had written down. 
<br />
It's always advised and I've advised myself to never quit. No matter the odds. Because success comes through fruition finally. If we push with absolute relentlessness.
